# Tailwind CSS Gradient Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while using Tailwind CSS gradients. The gradient appears distorted, showing unexpected color transitions or variations from the specified colors.

## Bug Description
The `bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500` utility class is expected to produce a smooth gradient transition from blue to purple. However, the rendered gradient is visually incorrect, possibly displaying banding, abrupt color changes, or inaccurate color representation. This might be due to browser inconsistencies or unexpected interactions with other CSS rules.

## Solution
The solution explores various approaches to address the gradient issue, including explicit color definitions, fallback gradients, and adjusting gradient angle.
